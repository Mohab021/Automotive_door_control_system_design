# Automotive door control system design
In the automotive industry, ECUs are communicating together to provide safety and driver's comfort.
ECUs are microcontrollers connected with input and output devices, input devices to sense the surrounding environments, and output devices to perform actions according to readings that came from input devices.

## System Description
The purpose of this project is to provide a fully static design as well as a fully dynamic design for two ECUs communicating together to control car lights according to door state, light sitch state, and car speed state.
